Git, Remote Repository at GitHub.com, and PS1 Script in Visual Studio Code

Step-by-Step Workflow

1. Make Changes Locally
- What Happens:
  - Open your script (`.ps1` or any other file) in a code editor like Visual Studio Code or Notepad.
  - Modify the script and save your changes.
  
- Context:
  - These edits exist only on your local file system (on your laptop) and are not yet tracked by Git.
  - At this stage, the changes are stored in the working directory, but Git is unaware of them.

2. Open Git Bash
- What Happens:
  - Launch Git Bash, which is a terminal emulator for interacting with your local Git repository.
  
- Context:
  - Use Git Bash to execute Git commands that track, commit, and synchronize changes with the remote repository on GitHub.

3. Stage Changes with `git add`
```bash
git add <file-name>
```
- What Happens:
  - The modified file is staged, meaning it is moved from the working directory to the staging area.
  - Staging lets you specify exactly which files or changes you want to include in your next commit.
  
- Details:
  - To stage all changes, use:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
  - This command stages all modified and newly created files in the current repository.

4. Commit Changes with `git commit`
```bash
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
```
- What Happens:
  - Git saves (commits) the staged changes into your local repository as a new snapshot of the project.
  - Include a meaningful commit message to describe what changes were made and why.

- Context:
  - Each commit acts as a checkpoint in your project’s history.
  - Changes are now securely recorded in the local repository but are not yet visible on GitHub.

5. Push Changes to GitHub with `git push`
```bash
git push origin main
```
- What Happens:
  - Your local commits are sent (pushed) to the remote repository on GitHub.
  - In the command:
    - `origin` refers to the remote repository on GitHub.
    - `main` refers to the branch where changes are being synced.

- Context:
  - Once pushed, your work becomes available on GitHub, where collaborators or teammates can access and pull the updates.
  - This ensures your local changes are backed up remotely.

Putting It All Together

Here’s how this workflow operates as a whole:

1. Edit Your Script Locally:
   - Use Visual Studio Code or any other editor to make changes to your script.
   - Save the changes, which remain on your local file system.

2. Stage the Changes:
   - Run `git add` to move the changes from the working directory to the staging area.

3. Commit Your Changes:
   - Use `git commit` to save a snapshot of the staged changes in your local Git repository, along with a descriptive message.

4. Push to GitHub:
   - Use `git push` to send your changes to the remote GitHub repository, ensuring the changes are available online and backed up.

Why This Workflow Matters

Version Control:
- Each commit represents a new version of your project, allowing you to track changes, undo mistakes, and maintain a clear project history.

Collaboration:
- Once changes are pushed to GitHub, collaborators can pull your updates and contribute, ensuring everyone works on the most up-to-date version.

Safety:
- By syncing to GitHub, you have a backup of your work stored remotely, protecting it from accidental data loss on your local machine.

You're absolutely right—while Git is a vast tool, there are a few indispensable commands that will cover most of your everyday tasks. Here's a list of **20 essential Git commands** every developer should know:

---

### **Setting Up a Git Repository**
1. `git init`  
   - Initializes a new Git repository in your project folder.

2. `git clone <repo-url>`  
   - Clones an existing repository from a remote source (like GitHub) to your local machine.

---

### **Basic Workflow**
3. `git status`  
   - Shows the current state of your working directory (e.g., changes staged, unstaged, or untracked).

4. `git add <file>`  
   - Stages changes of a specific file for the next commit.

5. `git add .`  
   - Stages all changes in the working directory.

6. `git commit -m "Your message"`  
   - Creates a snapshot of the staged changes with a commit message.

7. `git push origin <branch>`  
   - Pushes local commits to the remote repository (to the specified branch).

8. `git pull`  
   - Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository into your current branch.

---

### **Branch Management**
9. `git branch`  
   - Lists all branches in the repository.

10. `git branch <branch-name>`  
    - Creates a new branch.

11. `git checkout <branch>`  
    - Switches to the specified branch.

12. `git merge <branch>`  
    - Merges another branch into your current branch.

---

### **Viewing and Undoing Changes**
13. `git log`  
    - Displays a history of commits.

14. `git diff`  
    - Shows differences between changes in your working directory and the last commit.

15. `git reset <file>`  
    - Removes a file from the staging area (but keeps changes in the working directory).

16. `git reset --hard`  
    - Resets the working directory and staging area to match the last commit (destructive!).

---

### **Remote Repositories**
17. `git remote add origin <url>`  
    - Links a local repository to a remote repository.

18. `git fetch`  
    - Downloads updates from a remote repository without merging them.

---

### **Utilities**
19. `git stash`  
    - Temporarily saves changes without committing them, allowing you to work on something else.

20. `git tag <tag-name>`  
    - Adds a tag to a specific commit for easy reference.
